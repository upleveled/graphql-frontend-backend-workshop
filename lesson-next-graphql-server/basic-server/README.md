# Apollo Server - Basic Node.js Server

1. Create a repository on GitHub (let's base the name on the upcoming exercise, something like `graphql-basic-server`)
2. Clone the new repository in your `projects` directory
3. `cd` into the directory

Follow the steps on https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/, changing the `npm` commands to the `yarn` equivalents instead.
